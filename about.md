Present

I work on electronics testing and validation in Palo Alto, CA. Specialties include developing test hardware, PCB debug, test automation (Python, C), and data capture/analysis.

In my spare time, I work on EE hardware projects and play piano.

Past

From 2012 to 2014, I lived in Nanjing, China, studying at the [Hopkins-Nanjing Center for Chinese and American Studies](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/graduate-studies/campuses/nanjing-china#about-hopkins-nanjing-center). My Chinese-language master's thesis was an economic study of wind vs. coal power across China's 32 main provinces and regions.

I graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu/) in 2012. During my time there, I was deeply involved in Engineers Without Borders.

I grew up in Maryland, in a suburb of Washington D.C.
