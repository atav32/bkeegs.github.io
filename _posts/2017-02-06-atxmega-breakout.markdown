Made a simple breakout board for the [ATXMEGA32C4-AUR](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/ATXMEGA32C4-AUR/ATXMEGA32C4-AURCT-ND/4119397) microcontroller. Planning to use this to get deeper understanding of and use the micro for various projects going forward.

As of 2/2/17, PCBs are already in from OSHpark, now waiting on components to build up a board or two.
