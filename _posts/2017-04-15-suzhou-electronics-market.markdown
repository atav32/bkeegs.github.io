I was in China for work recently, and on a weekend off I was in Suzhou so I decided to check out the Saige Electronics Market (赛格电子市场). After reading many posts on the much larger Shenzhen electronics market at Hua Qiang Bei (华强北) but not visited, I was interested to see an electronics market in a another region of China.

The main market is an expansive building with 5 floors, with the bottom three floors containing vendor stalls as far as you can see. The floors were organized along these lines:
* 1st floor - components of all types like passives, ICs, switches, and connectors to industrial manufacturing equipment like pneumatics, motors, pogo pins, and power supplies
* 2nd floor - EE lab tools and measurement equipment like soldering equipment, crimpers, and DMMs
* 3rd floor - security cameras, card readers, and security keypads sold in an endless array of stalls
* 4th & 5th floors - mostly vacant rooms, scattered with mom-and-pop electronics remanufacturing

I ended up purchasing a wall-wart supply, Wago connectors, some pointy DMM probes, and other small items--all for pretty cheap. It quickly became obvious something I've seen others mention before about Hua Qiang Bei; this type of place is much more "productive" to visit with a BOM in hand, and a reference for how much each part should cost. One item I hoped to find but didn't was an off-brand [Molex universal crimper](https://www.amazon.com/Molex-63811-1000-Service-Grade-Crimping/dp/B00OVF2AKI) which usually goes for about $55 in the US. There were many other crimpers available though.

Across a small outdoor hallway was a 4+ floor building (赛格数码广场) dedicated to cell phones, computers, and accessories dealers. They had repair booths for doing computer and phone repair as well. Here I picked up a few cheap USB LED sticks and some iPhone selfie fans. Many of the fans had a convenient removable silicone-housed adapter that easily switched the power connector from a USB Micro-B to the Apple lightning connector.

Talking with vendors about their products was straightforward and people tended to be patient with me not knowing the technical words for certain things. In parts of China where foreigners are less common, simple interactions can be hard if you're Western-looking regardless of your language level. Suzhou, being very developed and located just West of Shanghai, has a fair amount of expats and people are easier to interact with.

My feeling is that the energy and scale of Hua Qiang Bei far exceeds this market, but it was a lot of fun to poke around the Saige Electronics Market for a few hours.
I'm looking forward to a trip to Shenzhen sometime!
